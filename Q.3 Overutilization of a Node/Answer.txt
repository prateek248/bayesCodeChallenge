Below is my action plan:
1. I will check the below metrices using infrastructure monitoring tool console:
    - CPU utilization
    - Memory utilization
    - Swap utilization
    - Network throughput
    - Disk utilization
2. Then I will check why this node is overloaded with requests by describing the tags on the node.
3. Post that I will whether my load balancer service is working fine or not. Might be a case that somehow the node exited the target group or there is a rule because of which maximum load is being catered by this node only.
4. I will logon to the server and see the outputs of below:
    - "top" command to see cpu utilization by process
    - "free -m" command to see available memory and swap.
    - "df -kh" to see if any device is getting heavily occupied resultiung in inability to write.
    - "iostat" to see reads/writes
    - "vmstat" to see virtual memory stats.
5. Then I will check system logs in /var/log/messages
6. I will check if the log file of the application is being made immutable by someone.
7. Validate if the application logs are being written on an network file system and if iuts unmounted.
8. Validate if log file is used by some other process.
9. Go through application logs to see any OOM exceptions or any other uncaught errors and exceptions.
